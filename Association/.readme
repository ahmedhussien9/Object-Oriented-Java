/**
Association indicates a loose relationship between two objects, which may interact with each other
for some time. They are not dependent on each other-if one object is destroyed, the other can continue to exist,
and there can be any number of each item in the relationship.

One Object does not belong to another, and they may have numbers that are not tied to each other.

An Example of association relationship could be a person and a hotel. A person might interact with a hotel
but not own one. A hotel may interact with many people.
